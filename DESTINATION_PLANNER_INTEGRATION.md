# Destination Planner Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Pre-Planner Agent (Destination Planner) into the AI-First Smart Itinerary Planner system. The integration enables users who are uncertain about their destination to receive intelligent, ranked recommendations based on their requirements.

## Components Modified

### 1. **Created: `/app/agents/__init__.py`**
- Centralized agent exports
- Makes all agent node functions importable from the agents package

### 2. **Updated: `/app/core/router.py`**
**Changes:**
- Added `DESTINATION_PLANNER` to valid agents list
- Added early detection logic for destination uncertainty before LLM routing
- Detects phrases like:
  - "don't know where"
  - "help me choose"
  - "suggest destination"
  - "where should i go"
  - "recommend a place"
- Routes to DESTINATION_PLANNER when:
  - User has no destination set AND asks for help
  - State metadata indicates `preplanner_phase: true`
  - Destination has been selected → routes to PLANNER

### 3. **Updated: `/app/core/graph.py`**
**Changes:**
- Imported `preplanner_agent_node` from `core.destination_planner`
- Added `destination_planner` node to the state graph
- Created `route_after_destination_planner()` function:
  - Routes to `router` if destination selected (continues to PLANNER)
  - Routes to `end` if waiting for user selection
- Updated `route_after_router()` to include `destination_planner` option
- Added conditional edges from destination_planner node

**Graph Flow:**
```
User Query
    ↓
Router (detects uncertainty)
    ↓
Destination Planner
    ↓
Provides recommendations with D tokens (D1, D2, D3...)
    ↓
[Graph ends, waits for selection]
    ↓
User selects D1
    ↓
handle_user_selection() updates state
    ↓
Router → PLANNER (normal planning flow)
```

### 4. **Updated: `/app/core/follow_up.py`**
**Changes:**
- Added `generate_destination_suggestions()` function:
  - Generates D1, D2, D3... tokens for destination selection
  - Adds D99 for "refine search" option
  - Creates user-friendly selection menu
  
- Modified `generate_follow_up_suggestions()`:
  - Checks if in `preplanner_phase`
  - Calls `generate_destination_suggestions()` if true
  - Otherwise generates normal A1, A2, A3... suggestions

- Updated `handle_user_selection()`:
  - Handles D tokens for destination selection
  - Imports `handle_destination_selection()` from destination_planner
  - Updates state with selected destination
  - Sets `destination_selected: true` flag
  - Sets `next_agent: PLANNER` to continue planning
  - Handles D99 for search refinement

### 5. **Updated: `/app/utils/config.yaml`**
**Added:**
```yaml
agents:
  destination_planner:
    enabled: true
    max_recommendations: 5
    use_tavily_research: true
    scoring_weights:
      weather: 0.25
      family_friendly: 0.20
      safety: 0.20
      budget: 0.15
      interests: 0.20
```

### 6. **Updated: `/app/example_usage.py`**
**Added:**
- `example_9_destination_planner()` function demonstrating:
  - User with uncertain destination
  - Complex requirements (family, weather, duration)
  - Destination selection from recommendations
  - Transition to full planning

### 7. **Environment Configuration**
- Added `TAVILY_API_KEY` to environment variables
- Verified API key is available in `/app/backend/.env`

## Integration Points

### State Metadata Structure
The destination planner uses these metadata fields:
```python
metadata = {
    "preplanner_phase": bool,        # Currently in destination discovery
    "destination_selected": bool,     # User has selected a destination
    "requirements": dict,             # Extracted travel requirements
    "selected_destination": dict      # Full details of selected destination
}
```

### Tool Results
Destination recommendations stored in:
```python
tool_results = {
    "destination_recommendations": {
        "recommendations": [
            {
                "destination": str,
                "country": str,
                "final_score": float,
                "why_suitable": str,
                "family_friendly_score": int,
                "safety_score": int,
                "estimated_daily_budget": int,
                "key_attractions": list,
                "research": dict  # From Tavily
            }
        ],
        "requirements": dict,
        "timestamp": str
    }
}
```

## Destination Planner Features

### 1. **Requirement Extraction (LLM-based)**
Extracts from user messages:
- Duration (days)
- Region/country preference
- Budget level
- Travel party details (adults, children, ages)
- Interests/activities
- Constraints (weather, accessibility, safety)
- Must-haves and must-avoids

### 2. **Destination Generation (LLM)**
- Generates 5-7 candidate destinations
- Considers all requirements and constraints
- Provides detailed reasoning for each

### 3. **Research Phase (Tavily)**
- Validates destinations with real-time data
- Searches for current information about:
  - Weather conditions
  - Family-friendly activities
  - Safety updates
  - Attractions
- Adds research insights to recommendations

### 4. **Intelligent Ranking**
Scoring algorithm with weighted factors:
- **Weather match (25%)**: Exact match with preferences
- **Family-friendly (20%)**: Higher weight if children present
- **Safety (20%)**: Critical for all travelers
- **Budget fit (15%)**: Matches user's budget range
- **Interest alignment (20%)**: Activities match interests

### 5. **Response Formatting**
- Top 3-5 recommendations with scores
- Detailed breakdown for each:
  - Match score (0-100)
  - Why suitable
  - Weather
  - Estimated daily budget
  - Family-friendly rating
  - Safety rating
  - Key attractions
  - Things to consider
  - Current research insights

## Testing Results

### Integration Tests (5/5 Passed ✅)
1. ✅ **Imports Test**: All modules import successfully
2. ✅ **Graph Structure**: destination_planner node included in graph
3. ✅ **Router Detection**: Correctly identifies uncertain destination queries
4. ✅ **Follow-up D-tokens**: Generates D1, D2, D3... tokens correctly

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run integration tests
python /app/test_integration_simple.py

# Run full examples (requires OpenAI API)
python /app/example_usage.py
```

## Usage Example

### User Flow:
```python
from main import ItineraryPlannerSystem

planner = ItineraryPlannerSystem()

# Step 1: User uncertain about destination
result = planner.process_query(
    query="I want to travel for 7 days with my family. We have 2 kids. "
          "I prefer mild weather and family-friendly activities. "
          "I don't know where to go.",
    thread_id="session_123"
)

# System provides recommendations with D tokens:
# [D1] Choose San Diego, California (Score: 95.0)
# [D2] Choose Orlando, Florida (Score: 92.0)
# [D3] Choose Seattle, Washington (Score: 88.0)
# [D99] Show different options or refine my search

# Step 2: User selects destination
result = planner.handle_suggestion_selection("D1", thread_id="session_123")

# System now has destination set and continues to full planning
# User can now request detailed itinerary creation
```

## API Requirements

### Required API Keys:
1. **OPENAI_API_KEY**: For LLM reasoning and extraction
2. **TAVILY_API_KEY**: For destination research (optional but recommended)

### Configuration:
```bash
# In .env or environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-dev-***"  # Already configured
```
