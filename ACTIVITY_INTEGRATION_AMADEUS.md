## 📦 What Was Implemented

### **1. Amadeus Tours & Activities API**

**Endpoint:** `/v1/shopping/activities`
```python
amadeus.tours_and_activities(
    latitude=35.6762,
    longitude=139.6503,
    radius=10  # km
)
```

**Returns:** 
- Activity name, description
- Pricing with currency
- Pictures/images
- Booking links
- Duration (ISO format)
- Rating

### **2. Activity Agent Integration**

**Flow:**
```
User Query: "Find activities in Tokyo"
    ↓
1. City Search: "Tokyo" → (35.6762, 139.6503)
2. Activities API: Search 10km radius
3. Parse Results: 300 activities found
4. Format: Categorize, extract duration, highlights
5. Return: Real activity data to user
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic city coordinate lookup
- ✅ Smart categorization (culture, food, nature, etc.)
- ✅ Duration parsing (PT2H → "2 hours")
- ✅ Highlight extraction
- ✅ Interest matching
- ✅ Graceful fallback to mock data

### **3. New Helper Functions**

```python
format_amadeus_activity(activity, destination, interests)
categorize_activity(name, description, interests)
extract_duration(activity)  # PT2H30M → "2.5 hours"
extract_highlights(description)
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Activity Search Flow**

```
User: "Find cultural activities in Tokyo"
    ↓
Activity Agent:
    1. Extract params: destination, interests
    2. City search: "Tokyo" → lat/long
    3. Amadeus API: tours_and_activities(35.67, 139.65)
    4. Parse: 300 activities
    5. Filter & categorize by interests
    6. Format for display
    ↓
Result: Real tours, real prices, booking links ✅
```

### **Smart Categorization**

Matches activities to user interests:
```python
User interests: ["culture", "food"]
    ↓
Activity: "Sushi Making Class"
    ↓
Categorized as: "food" ✅
```

**Categories:**
- culture
- food
- nature
- entertainment
- sightseeing

---

## 💻 Code Example

```python
from agents.activity_agent import execute_activity_search
from core.state import create_initial_state

state = create_initial_state("Find activities")

params = {
    "destination": "Tokyo",
    "interests": ["culture", "food"],
    "budget": "mid-range"
}

result = execute_activity_search(state, params)

# Check source
print(f"Source: {result['source']}")  # "amadeus_api"
print(f"Found: {len(result['activities'])} activities")  # 300!

# Show sample
for activity in result['activities'][:3]:
    print(f"- {activity['name']}: ${activity['price']}")
```
